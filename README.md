# Li-Fi-Based-Audio-Transmission-System
This repository contains the design and documentation of a Li-Fi based audio transmission system using visible light communication. The project demonstrates wireless audio transfer using an LED as the transmitter and a solar cell as the receiver, highlighting the fundamentals of optical wireless communication.
### 🔹 Components Used
- Arduino UNO  
- High-brightness LED (Transmitter)  
- Solar Cell / Photodiode Module (Receiver)  
- Audio Amplifier Circuit  
- Speaker  
- Potentiometers  
- Resistors and Capacitors  
- 5V DC Power Supply  
- Jumper Wires and PCB  

## 🔁 Working Principle
1. Audio input is fed into the system.
2. The audio signal modulates the intensity of the LED.
3. The LED transmits the signal using visible light.
4. The solar cell receives the light signal and converts it into an electrical signal.
5. The received signal is amplified.
6. The speaker reproduces the transmitted audio.
